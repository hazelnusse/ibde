Implement algorithm to compute steady turning quantities:

- Use VTK's level surface functionality to obtain configuration manifold
  -- split lean/pitch/steer into 8 sections
    -- lean -pi/2 to pi/2
    -- pitch -?? to ??
    -- steer -pi to pi
  -- for each point obtained from vtk's contouring,
    -- use Newton-Raphson to solve holonomic constraint to machine precision,
       by moving along surface normal direction.  The distance to move is
       upper bounded by the diagonal of the box.  The problem should be
       possible to set up as finding a root of a single variable function:

       g(alpha) = lps_vtk + alpha*grad(f_holonomic)_(lps_vtk)

       In this setup, lps_vtk and grad(f_holonomic)_(lps_vtk) are constants
       (the latter assumed to have unit lenght), and the algorithm is a single
       parameter line search.  The initial guess for alpha should be chosen to
       be small, probably zero or some very small fraction (<1%) of the diagonal of
       the box (determined by meshing of lean, pitch and steer).  The points
       that VTK determines are linear interpolations and should provide a very
       good approximation of where the configuration surface is, so an initial
       guess of alpha=0 should converge.

    -- with refined point on holonomic surface, compute the following
       quantities
         -- constraint matrix B from B(q)*u = 0
         -- SVD of B to determine best choice of independent generalized speeds
         -- It should be (need to verify) that only one of yaw rate, rear wheel
            rate, front wheel rate are in the optimal set of independent speeds
         -- In a steady turn generalized inertia forces depend only on three
            generalized speeds, since the others are zero.  yaw rate, rear
            wheel rate, and front wheel rate.  As such, only six types of
            acceleration terms will show up:  u0*u0, u0*u4, u0*u5, u4*u4,
            u4*u5, u5*u5.  In special cases (e.g. upright steady riding, or
            spinning about wheel contact point) one of these may be zero.
         -- determine:
            -- radius of rear wheel path:  use kinematic equations to determine
            velocity of contact point, then \dot{psi}*r = sqrt(\dot{x}^2 +
            \dot{y}^2) to solve for r.  Take psi = 0 in these equations, in
            which case \dot{y} = 0.
            -- position from rear wheel contact point to:
              -- rear wheel center
              -- rear assembly mass center
              -- front assembly mass center
              -- front wheel center
              -- front wheel contact point
              -- system mass center
            -- radius of circle travelled by all previous points
            -- front and rear mechanical trail
            -- steer axis tilt
         -- if v^2 >= 0, steady turn is possible, calculate:
           -- equilibrium steer torque
           -- eigenvalues
           -- lateral and normal reaction forces
