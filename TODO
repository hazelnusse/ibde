- Connect Meijaard parameter widget so it's functionality can be used like the
  default gyrostat parameter widget.

Implement algorithm to compute steady turning quantities:

- Use VTK's level surface functionality to obtain configuration manifold
    -- with refined point on holonomic surface, compute the following
       quantities
         -- constraint matrix B from B(q)*u = 0
         -- SVD of B to determine best choice of independent generalized speeds
         -- It should be (need to verify) that only one of yaw rate, rear wheel
            rate, front wheel rate are in the optimal set of independent speeds
         -- In a steady turn generalized inertia forces depend only on three
            generalized speeds, since the others are zero.  yaw rate, rear
            wheel rate, and front wheel rate.  As such, only six types of
            acceleration terms will show up:  u0*u0, u0*u4, u0*u5, u4*u4,
            u4*u5, u5*u5.  In special cases (e.g. upright steady riding, or
            spinning about wheel contact point) one of these may be zero.
         -- determine:
            -- radius of rear wheel path:  use kinematic equations to determine
            velocity of contact point, then \dot{psi}*r = sqrt(\dot{x}^2 +
            \dot{y}^2) to solve for r.  Take psi = 0 in these equations, in
            which case \dot{y} = 0.
            -- position from rear wheel contact point to:
              -- rear wheel center
              -- rear assembly mass center
              -- front assembly mass center
              -- front wheel center
              -- front wheel contact point
              -- system mass center
            -- radius of circle travelled by all previous points
            -- front and rear mechanical trail
            -- steer axis tilt
         -- if v^2 >= 0, steady turn is possible, calculate:
           -- equilibrium steer torque
           -- eigenvalues
           -- lateral and normal reaction forces
